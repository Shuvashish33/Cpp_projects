# Cpp_projects
This repository contains C++ implementations of computational physics methods i learned from my univery computational physics course. This include root-finding (Bisection, Secant, Newton–Raphson), numerical integration/differentiation (Euler, RK1–RK4, Simpson’s rules), random number generation, and Monte Carlo integration for a unit cube.
